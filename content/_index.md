# Our Vision

ObserVR is creating the solution to sports' biggest problem: how do fans experience a game safely? We are living in the midst of the world’s largest pandemic and learning to deal with a new way to live. Sports have been affected more than most industries, with the complete shut down at the start of the year to now where stadiums are empty and fans are craving the feeling of being close to the action.
